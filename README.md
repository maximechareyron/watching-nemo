# How to use our application

A Makefile is provided. It enables compiling both the server and the client.

To compile both the client and the server, simply run `make`.

In order to make the application work, you will need to have at least **java version 11.0.2** installed. You will also need to have JavaFX downloaded on your computer. The environment variable **PATH\_TO\_FX** will have to be set to your JavaFX installation PATH.

In order to execute the client, once it is compiled, simply run `make exec_client`.
